		<h1>1.</h1>

		<p>HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language". HTML markup language is a set of markup tags. HTML documents are described by HTML tags, and each HTML tag describes a different document. 
	URL stands for "Uniform Resource Locator”. URL is used to specify addresses on the World Wide Web. A URL is the fundamental network identification for any resource connected to the web.
	 Internetwork is a digital network formed through the connection of computer networks and gateways. An internetwork is a collection of individual networks, connected by intermediate networking devices, that functions as a single large network.</p>

		<p>The earliest snapshot of Google.com I found was from November 11 1998. The original site was only three lines of visible text, without any graphical assets or images. Below the header there were two links. One to the search engine prototype, and the second is a link to the same search engine but with a message saying “might work some of the time, prototype is more up to date”. Both links go to pages that look surprisingly similar to Google's homepage today. They use the same colorful logo. It looks like they dropped the exclamation mark at some point in time.

		<h3>3.</h3>
		
		<p>I chose to look up Kendrick Lamar’s website for my Artist, his website is http://www.kendricklamar.com. I like how simple the layout is, and it is really easy to navigate around. I like how he has links to some of his new music, newsletters, events, and news. The drop down menus lead you to other pages. He has uploaded photos and videos of his music. I like when you click on a tab how it doesn't open up a new tab. </p>

		<h4>4.</h4>
		
		<p>When I looked up this website in the archive the earliest date I could find was Aug 20th. The website still had professional qualities to it, but much more basic. The drop down menus were non existent. All there was were tabs with headings on in. The color has changed to a much more earthy tone, back then it was black red and grey. There are still professional photographs in the back ground with the same kind of posses. </p>
